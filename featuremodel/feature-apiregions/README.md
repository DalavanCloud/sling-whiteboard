# Apache Sling API Regions runtime component

The API Regions runtime component is implemented as an OSGi Framework Extension bundle.
This ensures that the runtime component is always present early in the startup process.

This component registers an OSGi resolver hook service which enforces the API regions at runtime. The component looks for properties files that provide the configuration of the API regions. The properties files are generated by the `org.apache.sling.feature.extension.apiregions` component during the extension post-processing.

As the component has no dependencies on any other component, the properties files are looked up via System Properties lookups:

* `apiregions.idbsnver.properties` - provides the location of the `idbsnver.properties` file.
* `apiregions.bundles.properties` - provides the location of the `bundles.properties` file.
* `apiregions.features.properties` - provides the location of the `features.properties` file.
* `apiregions.regions.properties` - provides the location of the `regions.properties` file.
