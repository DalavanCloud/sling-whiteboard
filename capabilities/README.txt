Sling Capabilities Module
=========================

This is a work in progress for a service that provides information on the capabilities
of a Sling instance: what is installed, version levels etc.

Capabilities are defined either by executing sets of Health Checks, selected by
tags, or by executing small scripts.

Each capability has a name and a value.

TODO: complete this, examples etc.
