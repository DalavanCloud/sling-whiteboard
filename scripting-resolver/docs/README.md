Apache Sling Scripting Reloaded - Documentation
====

The following links should help you get an understanding on how the `org.apache.sling.scripting.resolver` works, what it does and how you
can interact with it as a developer. Some demo bundles will help you get started faster, since they're also the modules we use for testing
this new way of scripts bundling and scripts resolution.

## Resources

1. The [`org.apache.sling.scripting.resolver`](scripting-resolver.md) - what, why and how?
2. The [`org.apache.sling.scripting.maven.plugin`](scripting-maven-plugin.md) - because you don't want to write boilerplate yourself, do you?!
